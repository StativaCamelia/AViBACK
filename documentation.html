          US Accidents Smart Visualizer(AVi) is a web application for flexible
          visualization of US accident data, based on our REST API. The system
          provides support for multi-criteria search for reported incidents,
          creating chart statistics in 3 manners - pie chart, bar chart and line
          chart - and a cartographic rendering. These statistics can be exported
          in CSV, PNG and SVG formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application also provides an authentication system, as well as a
          module for managing the entire system. A user subscribes to the
          newsletter based on the chosen criterion, thus receiving emails about
          his topic of interest. An admin can monitor and modify the databases
          of the two services exposed through the administration module.

          <p>
            In the first weeks we outlined the design of the user interface,
            sketching the structure of the pages, and then we started working on
            the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first elements created were the menu and the general layout of
            the application, then we went to details, on each page.
          </p>
          <!--            imaginile de la inceput-->
          <p>
            Along the way we added new elements to improve the visual experience
            of the user as well as elements that lead to the interaction with
            the services created later.
          </p>
          <p>Technologies</p>
          <p>
            The technologies used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, these being the
            basis of the presented interface. HTML was used in order to mark and
            structure the content of the pages, CSS has the role of stylizing
            this content and JavaScript gives dynamism to the pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the representation of the statistics we used the libraries D3.js
            (for pie chart) and Chart.js (for bar chart and line chart). D3.js
            is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data
            visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of SVG, HTML5 and CSS
            standards. Chart.js is a free open-source JavaScript library for
            data visualization. It's tooltip and legends features are useful to
            add the extra details on charts. Works very well on modern browsers
            and charts are cross browser and cross platform compatible.

          <p>After we finished the frontend part of the project, we started thinking about the implementation of the functionalities and how we will integrate them in the backend part of the application.</p>
          <p>Technologies</p>
          <p>Initially we established the technologies we will use. On the frontend side we migrated to Pug technology instead of HTML and on the backend side we chose Node.JS as the technology because we were easily familiar with JavaScript because we used it in the scripts on the frontend. For data storage, we chose to use MongoDB because it's a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents.</p>
          <p>Pug is a template engine for Node and for the browser. It compiles to HTML and has a simplified syntax, which can make you more productive and your code more readable. Pug makes it easy both to write reusable HTML, as well as to render data pulled from a database or API.</p>
          <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.</p>
          <p>MongoDB is a rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field, no matter how nested it may be within a document. Supports arrays and nested objects as values and allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.</p>
