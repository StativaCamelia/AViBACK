          | The United States is one of the busiest countries in terms of
          | road traffic with nearly 264 million vehicles registered and 218
          | million drivers holding a valid driving license. The level of
          | traffic is one of the reasons leading to more traffic accidents:
          | In 2015, there were some 6.3 million fatal, injury, and property
          | damage crashes that occurred in the U.S. alone.
